As part of SALT34, the SALT Equity and Diversity Committee (SALTED) and the SALT34 organizing committee will hold a workshop: *Supporting accessibility: Providing access services for deaf conference attendees*.

More equitable participation in academic discourse includes facilitating attendance and discussion at conferences for those who have not always had easy access, including deaf members of the academic community. Providing access services for deaf participants is an important but challenging component of conference organization, often due to constraints of budget and qualified personnel. 

This workshop brings panelists together to address questions related to providing access services, such as:

- What pathways are there for deaf participants to receive quality access to academic conferences? 
- What barriers stand in the way of providing these access services? 
- How can conference organizers make their conferences as accessible as possible? 
- What resources are available for academics wanting to make their presentations more accessible? 

The goal of this workshop is to provide semanticists with information on how to make their academic presentations and conferences more accessible and how to access institutional support for access services.

More information about the workshop will be available in the near future.
