As part of SALT34, the SALT Equity and Diversity Committee (SALTED) and the SALT34 organizing committee will hold a workshop at 11:20am-12:50pm on May 28, 2024: *Spotlighting sign languages in semantics*.

Sign languages have an important role to play in generative linguistics and especially in semantics. For instance, features of logical vocabulary that have been posited based on indirect evidence from spoken languages are overtly realized in sign languages, thus giving us key insights into foundational issues in semantics (Schlenker, 2018a,b, Schlenker et al., 2023, Zucchi, 2012; a.o.). We aim to highlight the importance of sign language and signed modality within the field of semantics and bring together panelists whose research focuses on sign languages to present some of their work.
