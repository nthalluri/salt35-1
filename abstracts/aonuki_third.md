One choice point in analyzing languages that have degrees as semantic primitives (Beck et al.’s (2009) +DSP languages) is whether 1) gradable adjectives (GAs) have context-independent denotations and rely on a covert morpheme pos to provide a contextual standard (e.g., Cresswell 1976) or 2) they are lexically context-dependent (e.g., Oda 2008, Cariani et al. 2023). In this first formal work on degree semantics in Gitksan (Tsimshianic), I argue for the latter. Evidence comes from availability of comparative readings and differential interpretations of measure phrases (MPs) without a degree operator. Gitksan has an overt morpheme k’aa, which gives rise to either comparative or superlative readings. However, bare relative adjectives can receive a comparative/superlative reading without k’aa, and co-occurring MPs receive obligatory differential readings. Bare minimum-standard adjectives, on the other hand, force absolute readings of MPs, and require k’aa for comparative/superlative interpretations.
