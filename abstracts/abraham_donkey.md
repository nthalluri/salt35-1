Present accounts of donkey anaphora require increasing the complexity of the semantics, and then hand-crafting the quantifiers to play nicely with these enhanced meanings. I show that it is possible to account for donkey anaphora while keeping the semantics of quantification simple, by separating the introduction of a quantifier's domain from where it takes scope.
