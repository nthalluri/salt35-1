Longstanding tradition in the literature uses \[HON\] to analyze tiered honorification systems of Indo-Aryan. This work explores an analysis outside that tradition, using Wang's (2023) presuppositional account which does not make use of \[HON\]. I make a crucial modification to Wang (2023) and show how it can explain the diachronic and synchronic patterns of Indo-Aryan honorification.
