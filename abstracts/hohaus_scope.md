We offer a compositional analysis of a type of *inversion illusion*, focusing on *under-over sentences* like *Chomsky's importance cannot be underestimated*. Such sentences are normally construed as being equivalent to *Chomsky's importance cannot be overestimated*, i.e. that Chomsky is very important. This reading, however, is often claimed to be illusory; the correct interpretation is argued to be one in which Chomsky is extremely *unimportant*. Building on Hohaus & Bade's (2023) analysis of *depth-charge sentences* (Wason & Reich 1979), our analysis derives both readings compositionally via the different scopes of a negated modal with respect to a comparative contributed by *under- *and their interaction with maximal informativity. Both cases of alleged but empirically robust illusions can be understood from a unified semantic perspective, highlighting the value of rigorous formal analysis.
