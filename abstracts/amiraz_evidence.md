The source of the exhaustivity inference is the most controversial aspect of the meaning of clefts. This paper argues that negated clefts trigger a previously undescribed inference that I term potential exhaustivity. This finding challenges the widely held view that cleft exhaustivity does not project and thus provides compelling evidence that exhaustivity is a presupposition.
