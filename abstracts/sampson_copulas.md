In American Sign Language (ASL), the sign SELF(-ONE) has been found to function as a copula in predicating nominal phrases, as seen in J-O-H-N SELF-ONE DOCTOR (Sampson & Mayberry 2022). In my talk, I identify the main difference between using SELF-ONE as opposed to IX as indicating grammatical modality, or the ways to express the relationship of the expression to truth or belief. I show that SELF-ONE conveys a truth-conditional statement, indicating that the sentence is unconditionally true. This contrasts with IX, as seen in J-O-H-N IX DOCTOR, where there is no such truth-conditionality and the statement only merely reflects the signer's observations or beliefs. I postulate that the strategy of using SELF-ONE emerged as a way to distinguish between explicit and implicit meanings. This appears to have resulted from a shift from expressing such meanings with non-manual markers to manual signs, which are likewise observed in other avenues of language change like lexicalization and grammaticalization (Frishberg 1975, Sampson & Mayberry 2022, in prep).
