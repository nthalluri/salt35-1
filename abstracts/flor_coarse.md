In this talk, novel data from Italian are argued to document the existence of a class of modal expressions which I call coarse.  The requirement that these expressions lexicalize, "coarseness", is implemented as a property that holds of the conversational backgrounds and the prejacent proposition, crucially relying on a Kratzerian analysis of modality.
