The description of *de re* is that an individual denoting expression A embedded under an intensional operator B is evaluated transparently relative to B. Consensus has it that this is to be derived by replacement R of [[A]] with alternative concepts (Quine 1956, Kaplan 1968, Lewis 1979, a.o.). We make four novel contributions: (i) R in *de re* construals is dependent on the Question Under Discussion. (ii) No ambiguity between *de re* and *de dicto* exists, and R is involved in both construals. (iii) There is no restriction in *de re* to individuals, as generalized non-*de dicto* phenomena share properties (i) and (ii). (iv) A novel analysis  extending R to all non-*de-dicto* cases: each expression contributes alternatives, intensional operators existentially quantify  over them, yielding parallelism, with quantification restricted by the Question Under Discussion.
