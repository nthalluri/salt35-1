Marathi (Southern Indo-Aryan) is described as having a long-distance anaphor, *apəɳ*, which in argument positions can only be coreferent with a non-local subject (Wali et al. 1991, Pandharipande 1998). It has not previously been noted that there is a perspectival component to the semantics of long-distance *apəɳ*: it is licensed only in attitude reports, where it must refer *de se* to the attitude holder. More surprisingly, no clausemate of *apəɳ* can be interpreted *de re*: names, definite descriptions, and properties must be read *de dicto*, and tense must be interpreted *de se*. Yet the *apəɳ* clause remains transparent to syntactic operations, like *wh*-dependencies and NPI licensing, and therefore resists a quotation analysis. I account for its properties by pursuing an operator-driven context shift analysis (Anand & Nevins 2004, Anand 2006, Deal 2020, a.o.), where *apəɳ* itself is a special type of shifted author-addressee indexical. The strict prohibition on *de re* is due to an operator in the clausal left periphery which 1) overwrites the context world parameter relative to which its complement is evaluated and 2) imposes a requirement that the attitude holder assent to the reported proposition at the attitude time and world.
