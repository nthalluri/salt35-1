This paper distinguishes and analyzes two types of as phrases (asPs). In *Eloise is kind as a teacher*, the asP specifies a dimension of Eloise's kindness. In *Eloise is on strike as a teacher*, the asP references the capacity through which she is on strike. Landman (1989), Moltmann (2003), Asher (2006) and Zobel (2018) have analyzed these asPs as a single class. I build on their work by introducing novel data that indicates a semantic contrast between these two asPs. I propose that 'dimensional' asPs (kind as...) specify scales of multidimensional adjectives (using Sassoon 2016's definition). 'Capacity' asPs (on strike as...) link with a wider range of predicates via Kratzerian situations. Treating dimensional asPs as a distinct class specifically provides a new perspective for understanding subsective modification (e.g. kind teacher) and similative asPs.
