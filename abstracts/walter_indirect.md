It is argued that indirect discourse (ID) is an instance of mixed quotation. Results from a rating study are reported suggesting that self pointing gestures are acceptable in ID. The findings are analyzed in a modified account of Davidson's (2015) demonstrational account of quotation. Moreover, this analysis can straightforwardly account for observations that some indexicals can receive a shifted interpretation in ID (e.g., Plank, 1986).
